This GitHub repository hosts the source code for an Employee Management System developed using Spring Boot, JPA (Java Persistence API), and MySQL. This project provides a comprehensive solution for managing employee data within an organization efficiently.

Features:
Employee CRUD Operations: Enables the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of employee records.
Department Management: Allows the management of departments, including adding, updating, and deleting departments.
Authentication and Authorization: Implements secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to the system.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assigns roles to users and restricts access to specific functionalities based on their roles.
Search and Filtering: Provides functionality to search and filter employees based on various criteria such as name, department, etc.
Reporting: Generates reports on employee data, such as department-wise employee lists, employee statistics, etc.
Data Validation: Validates input data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Error Handling: Handles exceptions gracefully to provide a smooth user experience.
Logging and Auditing: Logs system activities and maintains an audit trail for accountability and security purposes.
Integration with MySQL Database: Utilizes MySQL as the backend database to store and manage employee and department data efficiently.
Technologies Used:

Spring Boot: A powerful framework for building Java-based applications with minimal configuration.
JPA (Java Persistence API): A standard specification for accessing, managing, and persisting data between Java objects and relational databases.
MySQL: An open-source relational database management system widely used for storing structured data.
Java: The primary programming language used for implementing the backend logic.
Maven: A build automation tool used for managing dependencies and building the project.

# AngularFrontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
